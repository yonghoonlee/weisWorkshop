# weis-workshop

## The idea
The participants will (re)designs the IEA 22-MW to a 20MW turbine with a smaller rotor

- For computationally expensive optimizations we will provide pre-run results that can help move on to the next section.
- Analyzing & interpreting the results will be a major focus.
